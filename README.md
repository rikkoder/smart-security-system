## SMART SECURITY SYSTEM

This is an old college project which uses a matrix keypad module and maps it as several input and function buttons logically. If no of wrong attempts increases above a threshold it sends a notification to user via internet (a camera module can be attached to send the photo or live stream of the adversary). This implementation is a POC only and doesn't incorporate simple features like passwords reset, thus it shouldn't be used as production in any case.
